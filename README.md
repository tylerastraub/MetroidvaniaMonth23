# Metroidvania Month 23 Game Jam

Theme: Ancient

Overview
- Metroidvania where you have to unlock everything (including basic movement and dialogue)
- Ancient artifacts grant you new powers to navigate the ruins and discover new areas
- Enemies possess their own ancient powers too, but more importantly, can take away YOUR powers temporarily
    - Certain enemies restrict some of your powers to offer unique ways to work through engagements, solve puzzles, and platform
    - This is core gameplay loop
- 1 boss, multiple areas. Boss has a bunch of the enemy powers
